# OpenMark

With **3 BILLION gamers** and **millions of games** worldwide, gaming offers more than just entertainment. It enhances **focus, problem-solving, hand-eye coordination, memory, creativity, and multitasking** while also reducing stress and improving social skills.

Modern games have reached unprecedented levels of complexity and graphical fidelity, pushing the boundaries of technology. However, one aspect remains outdated—**in-game items**. Due to technological barriers, regulatory challenges, and slow adaptation, in-game assets are still handled through **centralized, insecure, illiquid systems** with limited ownership rights.
