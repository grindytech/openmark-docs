# How to create Collection or Item?

You can easily mint your own NFT directly into your crypto wallet using OpenMark Studio tools. Minting is the process of publishing an NFT onto the blockchain, and with OpenMark, no coding knowledge is required. All you need is some cryptocurrency to cover gas fees and the artwork you want to turn into an NFT.

This step-by-step guide will walk you through creating an NFT collection and minting it directly to your wallet.

**Step 1:** On OpenMark, Select Create.

After selecting Create a new collection, follow the on-screen instructions to deploy a smart contract. This will enable you to create NFTs for your collection.

* **Logo Image:** This image appears next to your collection name and can be updated even after the contract is deployed.
* **Contract Name:** This is the name of your NFT collection. It will be visible on-chain and cannot be changed once the contract is deployed.
* **Token Symbol:** This is a short identifier for your contract (typically 4-7 characters). It will be visible on-chain and cannot be altered after the contract is deployed.

When you’re ready, click Create Collection. A transaction signature request will appear in your wallet, which will require gas fees. After the transaction is complete, you'll see a confirmation message.\


**Step 4:** Now that you’ve created a smart contract, you’re ready to mint an NFT.&#x20;

* **Upload Your NFT’s Media:** This is the artwork for your NFT. You can either drag and drop the file or upload it from your computer.
* **Select the Collection:** Choose the collection where you’d like to mint your NFT.
* **Name Your Item and Set Supply:** Enter a name for your item and specify the number of copies you wish to mint. Setting the supply to 1 will make the item unique.
* **Customize Your NFT:** Optionally, add a description, an external link, and traits to further define your NFT.
* **Click Create:** A loading message will appear while the item is being minted. You will need to approve the transaction in your wallet to complete the minting process.

Congratulations! You’ve just minted your first NFT. Next, you can customize your collection page and update your collection details.
