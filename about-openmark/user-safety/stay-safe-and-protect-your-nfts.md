# Stay Safe and Protect Your NFTs

## Never Share Your Secret Recovery Phrase

Your wallet's secret recovery phrase is exclusively for you and should never be shared, even with trusted individuals. OpenMark will never ask for this information, as it is not a wallet provider.

## Avoid Clicking on Unknown or Broken Links

Be vigilant while browsing or interacting on social media or Discord. Avoid clicking on ads, images, or links from strangers, as they could be phishing attempts or contain malware.

## Limit Smart Contract Approvals

If you're using MetaMask, regularly review and manage your spending limits when approving transactions. For more details, refer to MetaMask's support documentation on how to adjust your approvals.
