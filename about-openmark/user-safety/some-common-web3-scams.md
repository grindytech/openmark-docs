# Some common web3 scams

## Scam Emails

Scammers often use emails to impersonate reputable platforms. Common scam emails include fake offer notifications, "unusual login" alerts, and messages about "errors" or "transaction failures" that urge you to pay to resolve the issue.&#x20;

Always scrutinize the sender's email address, and remember that legitimate emails from OpenMark will come from a domain like “tanssi.openmark.io.” If the domain is different, it's likely a scam.

## Scam Social Media Messages

Scams also frequently occur through social media messages. Be cautious of direct messages (DMs) from unknown individuals, especially if they claim to represent OpenMark or request you to send funds or click on suspicious links. OpenMark will never send unsolicited DMs on social media.

## Fake OpenMark Websites

Scammers may create fake websites that mimic OpenMark to trick users into revealing sensitive information or transferring funds. Always ensure that the URL is correct when using OpenMark, specifically[ https://tanssi.openmark.io](https://tanssi.openmark.io). If the URL is different, it's not the legitimate OpenMark site.
