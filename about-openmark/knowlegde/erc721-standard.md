# ERC721 Standard

The **ERC-721 Standard** is a type of token on the EVM-based blockchain for making NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Each token is unique, unlike regular ERC-20 tokens, so it’s great for one-of-a-kind digital things like art, collectibles, or game items.

### Why ERC-721?

ERC-721 was created because people needed a way to own and trade digital stuff that’s special and can’t be copied. Regular tokens like ERC-20 are all the same, but ERC-721 lets each token have its own ID and details, proving who owns it. It’s perfect for things like digital art or rare items that need to stand out and stay with one owner at a time.

ERC-721 helps by:

* Giving **unique ownership**: Every NFT has its own ID, so it’s clear who has it.
* Making **trading possible**: You can sell or swap NFTs on marketplaces like OpenMark.
* Supporting **cool ideas**: It’s used for art, games, or anything where each piece matters.

It’s been around since 2018 and started the NFT boom, making it a big deal for digital creators and collectors.

### When You Want ERC-721

Use ERC-721 when you want your digital stuff to be one-of-a-kind and owned by just one person. It’s best for things like artwork, game characters, or collectibles that don’t split up. Each NFT stays whole and works with NFT marketplaces or apps that track ownership.
