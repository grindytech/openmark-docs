# How to Create Your Own Drop on OpenMark?

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/IVM3jRzQdUs" %}

A **Drop** is a container for multiple **Stages (Launchpads)** inside it. Previously, you learned [how to launch an NFT collection](https://wiki.openmark.io/about-openmark/how-to-use-openmark-studio/how-to-create-a-drop) with just a few clicks. By default, collections are launched in **Open Launchpad**, a **community Drop** where anyone can create a stage.

But what if you want **your own Drop**â€”one that only **you** can manage?

For example, if you're launching a game, you might want a dedicated **Game Drop** where players can explore different **Stages** to mint your in-game assets.

**Why Create Your Own Drop?**

1. Full control over who can create stages.
2. Custom branding for a better user experience.
3. Choose **any payment token** for your Drop.
