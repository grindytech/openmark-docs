# How to Generate an NFT Collection?

### Three main types of NFT collections

#### **1. Layered NFT Collection**

This is the most popular type, used by famous collections like **Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Pudgy Penguins, and Azuki**. These NFTs are generated by combining different layers (e.g., **Body, Hat, Hair, Face**) to create unique variations.

**Best for:** Large collections (e.g., 10,000 NFTs) with randomized traits and rarity.

#### **2. Single Image Collection**

This type contains multiple NFTs that share the **same image or GIF**. It’s commonly used for **membership NFTs, exclusive passes, or in-game items**.

**Best for:** Membership collections, event passes, and gaming assets.

#### **3. Mixed NFT Collection**

A mix of different standalone images without shared attributes or rarity distribution. Unlike **Layered Collections**, these NFTs are not generated from traits but are individual artworks.

**Best for:** Game item collections (e.g., different weapons, skins, or accessories).
