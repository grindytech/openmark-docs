# How to use OpenMark Studio?

By providing a no-code, decentralized platform, OpenMark enables anyone—from artists to businesses—to easily create, customize, and launch NFT collections without the need for technical expertise.&#x20;

This not only democratizes the creation process but also accelerates the time-to-market for unique digital assets. With the ability to generate NFTs from various file types, set rarity, and manage supply, creators can fully control their collections.&#x20;

The ability to quickly launch drops and sell NFTs directly from the platform makes OpenMark an invaluable tool for maximizing reach and profitability in the rapidly growing NFT market.
